# Air Hockey

This game was made using the awesome pygame module as a way to gain ideas about in game design and object oriented approach to a problem.

## How to run it?

- At first you need to have python installed. I've used Python 3.8.1 and you can get the latest version of python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Then use pip to install pygame. Usually pip comes with Python. If not then get it from [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
- Compile and run the >**main.py** script.
